In order to build QPG you will need to have Qt4 developer packages installed.

Building QPG is a four step process:

1.
	Run qmake:
		
		qmake
		
	Make sure to run the qmake version coming with qt4. The name of the binary
	may differ on some platforms. (qmake-qt4 on Ubuntu as an example)
	
2.
	Start the build with
		
		make
		
3.
	Now you have an rudimentary QPG that is able to generate a parser for its
	own grammer. To do so run
	
		./qpg -b1
		
	This will trigger QPG to generate the files Parser_gen.h, Parser_gen.cpp, 
	REParser.h and REParser_gen.cpp. 
	
4.
	Now you can run
	
		qmake
		
	and
	
		make
		
	again, which should produce a working generator.
	

There is no "make install" yet. So you will have to install manually.

There is not much documentation availabe right now (2010-09-16).
See the doc/README.txt for what hopefully will become useful docs.
Running qpg without any arguments will print a short usage message.
Also, there are the files re.qpg and qpg.qpg in the src directory, which
contain the grammers for the regular expressions parser and the main parser
itself. They might serve as a usage example until real documentation is
available. (Hopefully soon!)
